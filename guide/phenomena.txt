Phenomena that are measured by the app
======================================

GPS Position
------------
Latitude and longitude coordinates (WGS84) via the smartphone's GPS device

Time
----
Measurement time according to internal clock of the device.

Speed
-----
Speed values from the OBD-2 adapter in km/h

MAF
---
The MAF sensor measures the amount of air that is flowing into the engine in l/s. The air/fuel-ratio in the engine has to remain constant in order to allow a combustion of the air/fuel-mixture. We therefore measure how much air is used to estimate the current fuel consumption.

Fuel consumption
----------------
Fuel consumption based on the MAF estimations in l/s.

CO2 emission
------------
Burning 1 litre of fuel results in the same amount of CO2 emissions (under equal pressure and temperature conditions). Therefore, we can calculate the CO2 emissions in kg/s from the fuel consumption.
